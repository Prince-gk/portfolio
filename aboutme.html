            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a passionate and driven individual with a love for web development and design. Over the past few years, I’ve honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, developing websites that are both functional and visually appealing. 
                <br><br>
                In my free time, I enjoy learning new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and staying up to date with the latest trends in the tech world. Whether it's creating a user-friendly experience or solving complex coding problems, I am always eager to take on new challenges.
                <br><br>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring nature, reading books on personal growth, or enjoying a cup of coffee at my favorite café.
