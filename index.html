                <h2 class="about">About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a highly motivated and dedicated web developer with a robust background in full-stack development, with a particular focus on building user-centric, responsive websites and applications. My journey began with a passion for technology and problem-solving, which eventually led me to study Software Engineering at Moringa School. There, I gained extensive hands-on experience in coding and software development methodologies, equipping me with the skills to solve real-world problems through code.
                    <br><br>
                    Prior to joining Moringa, I completed my high school education at Chogoria Boys High School, where I first discovered my love for technology. Over the years, I have worked on a wide variety of projects ranging from small business websites to complex e-commerce platforms and dynamic web applications, honing my skills in both front-end and back-end development.
                    <br><br>
                    My technical skillset includes proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, alongside modern libraries and frameworks such as React, Vue.js, and Angular for front-end development. On the back end, I am experienced with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, enabling me to build full-stack applications with ease. Iâ€™ve also implemented RESTful APIs, integrated third-party services, and designed scalable systems that can handle high-traffic applications.
                    <br><br>
                    Beyond coding, I am passionate about delivering seamless user experiences. I collaborate closely with designers to ensure that the projects I work on not only function well but are also aesthetically pleasing and intuitive for users. I thrive on building solutions that strike the perfect balance between functionality and design.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to my technical work, I regularly contribute to open-source projects and mentor aspiring developers, guiding them in improving their skills and building confidence in the tech space. My long-term goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of web development, creating innovative applications that solve everyday problems.

                <h3>Project 1: Personal Blog Platform</h3>
                <p>
                    This project is a comprehensive blogging platform that I built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The platform allows users to create accounts, write, and manage blog posts, and engage with other users through comments and likes. The back-end includes secure user authentication, and the entire application is designed to be highly scalable.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Key Features:</strong>
                    <ul>

                <h3>Project 2: E-commerce Website</h3>
                <p>
                    This e-commerce platform was developed for a local business, providing them with a complete online shopping experience. Built using React for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end, the site allows customers to browse products, add items to their cart, and securely check out using Stripe for payment processing.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Key Features:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dynamic product catalog with filtering by category, price, and availability</li>
                        <li>Shopping cart with persistent data stored in local storage</li>
